# Video Processing Script (Version 5)

In this version I first wanted to get CUDA working on my laptop so that processing went smoother. This ended up being something wrong with my computer's path. With that issue solved my self compiled version of opencv not being recognized. After that I went onto my first major change.

## Starting with voice modification

First I had to tell when someone is speaking. My first thought was OpenAI's whisper because of my auto note taking project. However after some investigation it seemed that unfortunately whisper only does transcriptions and not audio detection in the way I needed so I went searching and came across the VAD (Voice Activity Detection) webrtcvad. This worked great for my use case because it was able to tell the individual frames the voice was active. I could then take that data and apply some sort of distortion to it. <https://github.com/wiseman/py-webrtcvad/tree/master>
