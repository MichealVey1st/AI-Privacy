## Version 1 of the AI Privacy Editor

For the initial version of the AI Privacy Editor, I chose to implement **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** with the **Wider Face configuration**. This configuration is particularly effective for recognizing faces even when partially obscured by accessories such as sunglasses. The bounding boxes defined by YOLO can be directly repurposed as the regions for applying blur, simplifying the blurring process.

### Features Implemented
1. **Face Detection**: 
   - YOLO with the Wider Face configuration ensures robust face detection.
   - Each detected face is automatically blurred using the bounding box provided by YOLO.
   
2. **Blurring Method**:
   - Gaussian Blur is applied directly to the detected bounding boxes, creating an effective privacy filter.

3. **Video Processing Pipeline**:
   - The program processes videos frame-by-frame, applying face blurring to maintain privacy across the entire video.

### Code Functionality
The code is structured to load a YOLO model, process a video frame-by-frame, and blur detected faces. Here's an overview:

1. **Model Loading**:
   - The YOLO model is loaded using a configuration (`yolov3-face.cfg`) and weights (`yolov3-wider_16000.weights`).
   - The program defaults to **CPU processing**, which slows down performance.

2. **Video Handling**:
   - The program reads an input video (`input/input_video.mp4`) and extracts properties such as frame width, height, and FPS to ensure proper output formatting.
   - An H.264 codec is used to save the processed video as `output/output_video.mp4`.

3. **Face Detection and Blurring**:
   - Each frame is resized for faster processing.
   - YOLO performs face detection, producing bounding boxes that are slightly expanded for more natural blurring.
   - A Gaussian Blur is applied to the regions of interest (ROIs) within the bounding boxes, ensuring privacy.

4. **Progress Tracking**:
   - The **tqdm** library is used to display a progress bar, showing the frame-by-frame processing progress.

### Challenges Encountered
1. **Audio Transfer Issues**:
   - The output video does not retain the original audio track, resulting in silent processed videos.

2. **Performance Bottleneck**:
   - The system defaults to **CPU processing**, leading to slow detection speeds, especially on large videos.

3. **Limited User Customization**:
   - The program lacks a GUI/UI user interaction. Features such as selecting specific faces to blur or customizing blur intensity are not available.


This version serves as a foundational step toward a fully-featured AI-powered privacy editor.
